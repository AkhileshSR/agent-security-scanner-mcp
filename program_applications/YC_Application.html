<h1>Y Combinator Application - ProofLayer</h1>

<h2>FOUNDERS</h2>

<p class="question">Who writes code, or does other technical work on your product? Was any of it done by a non-founder? Please explain.</p>
<p class="answer">Divya Chitimalla (CEO/CTO) wrote 100% of the current product - the MCP server, 359 security rules, package hallucination detection system, and npm package. No non-founder work. The Chief Scientist contributes to adversarial ML research and guardrail design. All technical work is founder-built.</p>

<p class="question">What is your company going to make? Please describe your product and what it does or will do.</p>
<div class="answer">
<p>We built the first MCP-native security layer for AI coding agents.</p>
<p>AI agents (Claude Code, Cursor, Copilot, Windsurf) are writing 41% of all code globally, but 62% of AI-generated code contains vulnerabilities. Existing security tools (Snyk, Semgrep) scan code <em>after</em> it's committed - nobody protects the agent <em>while</em> it writes.</p>
<p>Our MCP server plugs directly into AI coding tools and provides three capabilities:</p>
<ol>
<li><strong>Prompt injection firewall</strong> - Scans instructions for malicious payloads before the agent executes them</li>
<li><strong>Code vulnerability scanning with auto-fix</strong> - 359 rules covering SQL injection, XSS, hardcoded secrets, command injection (OWASP Top 10) with automatic remediation suggestions</li>
<li><strong>Package hallucination detection</strong> - Verifies every dependency against 4.3M real packages across 7 ecosystems (npm, PyPI, crates.io, RubyGems, Go, Dart, CPAN)</li>
</ol>
<p>Live on npm today: <code>npm install agent-security-scanner-mcp</code></p>
<p>Works with Claude Code, Cursor, Windsurf, Cline - every major AI coding client.</p>
</div>

<p class="question">Where do you live now, and where would the company be based after YC?</p>
<p class="answer"><span class="placeholder">[City]</span>, USA / San Francisco, USA</p>

<p class="question">Explain your decision regarding location.</p>
<p class="answer">San Francisco for proximity to AI/security talent, enterprise customers, and the YC network. The AI coding tool ecosystem (Anthropic, Cursor, etc.) is concentrated in SF/Bay Area.</p>

<h2>PROGRESS</h2>

<p class="question">How far along are you?</p>
<div class="answer">
<p>Live product on npm with real users:</p>

<h2>IDEA</h2>

<p class="question">Why did you pick this idea to work on? Do you have domain expertise in this area? How do you know people need what you're making?</p>
<div class="answer">
<p><strong>Why this idea:</strong><br>
We discovered the problem firsthand. While using Claude Code to build a Rust application, 45% of the packages it suggested didn't exist. We ran 273 package hallucination tests and 512+ XSS vulnerability tests on Claude Sonnet 4.5. The results were alarming: 45% Rust package hallucination rate, 34% XSS success rate. Nobody was protecting developers from this.</p>

<p><strong>Domain expertise:</strong></p>
<ul>
<li>Divya: Founding CTO at Redbolt AI ($2M funded), top OSS contributor to NVIDIA Garak (AI red-teaming), Google Safe Browsing (phishing detection at billions of URLs), Akamai bot detection, Google Chronicle</li>
<li>Chief Scientist: Oracle Health AI (agent guardrails), Amazon AGI (adversarial ML at scale, KDD 2022), Bosch (black-box adversarial attacks, KDD 2021), GE Healthcare (LLM hallucination detection)</li>
</ul>

<p><strong>How we know people need this:</strong></p>
<ul>
<li>62% of AI-generated code has vulnerabilities (Cloud Security Alliance)</li>
<li>10,000+ new security findings per month from AI code - 10x spike in 6 months (Apiiro)</li>
<li>Posted our research on LinkedIn - security teams reached out asking for the tool</li>
<li>Developers don't want more warnings, they want auto-fix. We built that.</li>
</ul>
</div>

<p class="question">Who are your competitors? What do you understand about your business that they don't?</p>
<div class="answer">
<p><strong>Competitors:</strong></p>
<table>
<tr><th>Company</th><th>What They Do</th><th>Their Gap</th></tr>
<tr><td>Snyk ($8.5B)</td><td>Static code scanning</td><td>Scans after commit, no agent integration, no prompt injection</td></tr>
<tr><td>Semgrep ($204M)</td><td>Rule-based SAST</td><td>CLI-focused, not MCP-native, no package hallucination</td></tr>
<tr><td>Lakera ($30M)</td><td>LLM app firewall</td><td>Protects chatbots, not coding agents, no code context</td></tr>
<tr><td>SonarQube</td><td>Code quality</td><td>No LLM understanding, no agent workflow</td></tr>
</table>

<p><strong>What we understand that they don't:</strong></p>
<ol>
<li><strong>The agent IS the developer now.</strong> Security must run inside the agent's workflow (MCP), not as a separate tool humans remember to invoke.</li>
<li><strong>Package hallucination is a new attack vector.</strong> AI agents invent dependencies that don't exist - supply chain attacks waiting to happen. Nobody else detects this.</li>
<li><strong>Detection without remediation is noise.</strong> Developers ignore warnings. We built auto-fix for every rule - the agent finds the vuln, shows the fix, applies it.</li>
<li><strong>MCP is the distribution layer.</strong> One integration works across Claude Code, Cursor, Windsurf, Cline. Competitors would need to build separate integrations for each.</li>
</ol>
</div>

<p class="question">How do or will you make money? How much could you make?</p>
<div class="answer">
<p><strong>Revenue model:</strong></p>
<table>
<tr><th>Tier</th><th>Price</th><th>Features</th></tr>
<tr><td>Free (Open Source)</td><td>$0</td><td>CLI, local scanning, community rules</td></tr>
<tr><td>Team</td><td>$500-2K/mo</td><td>Team dashboard, audit logs, custom policies</td></tr>
<tr><td>Enterprise</td><td>Custom</td><td>SSO, SLA, dedicated onboarding, compliance reports</td></tr>
</table>

<p><strong>Additional revenue:</strong></p>
<ul>
<li>Usage-based pricing for CI/CD pipeline integration</li>
<li>Rule marketplace (custom rules for specific frameworks/industries)</li>
</ul>

<p><strong>Market size:</strong></p>
<ul>
<li>Agentic AI Security Market: $30.27B (2025) → $322B by 2033 (CAGR 34.4%)</li>
<li>Comparable: Snyk valued at $8.5B for human code security</li>
<li>Cursor alone: $500M ARR for AI coding</li>
</ul>

<p><strong>Our target:</strong></p>
<ul>
<li>Year 1: $100K ARR (3-5 enterprise pilots)</li>
<li>Year 2: $1M ARR (expand to 20-30 customers)</li>
<li>Year 3: $10M ARR (platform + marketplace)</li>
</ul>
</div>

<p class="question">Which category best applies to your company?</p>
<p class="answer">B2B / Developer Tools / Security</p>

<p class="question">If you had any other ideas you considered applying with, please list them.</p>
<div class="answer">
<ol>
<li><strong>Runtime agent behavior monitoring</strong> - Track what AI agents actually do (file writes, API calls, shell commands) and flag anomalies. Decided to focus on code security first - clearer value prop, faster validation.</li>
<li><strong>Agent-to-agent security</strong> - Protect multi-agent systems where Agent A's output becomes Agent B's input (state pollution attacks). Still interested - this is our Chief Scientist's research focus. May add later.</li>
<li><strong>AI code review as a service</strong> - Human-in-the-loop review for high-stakes AI-generated code. Too services-heavy, doesn't scale. Killed it.</li>
</ol>
</div>

<h2>EQUITY</h2>

<p class="question">Have you formed ANY legal entity yet?</p>
<p class="answer placeholder">[Yes/No - to be filled]</p>

<p class="question">Have you taken any investment yet?</p>
<p class="answer">No</p>

<p class="question">Are you currently fundraising?</p>
<p class="answer">Yes</p>

<h2>CURIOUS</h2>

<p class="question">What convinced you to apply to Y Combinator? Did someone encourage you to apply? Have you been to any YC events?</p>
<div class="answer">
<p>Three reasons:</p>
<ol>
<li><strong>YC understands developer tools.</strong> Companies like Snyk, GitLab, and countless dev tools came through YC. Agent security is the next wave of dev tooling.</li>
<li><strong>Network access.</strong> We need enterprise design partners fast. YC's network reaches security buyers at scale-ups and enterprises who are actively deploying AI coding tools.</li>
<li><strong>Credibility signal.</strong> Cold outreach to security teams without backing = low response rate. "YC-backed" opens doors.</li>
</ol>
<p class="placeholder">[Note if encouraged by specific person or attended events]</p>
</div>

<p class="question">How did you hear about Y Combinator?</p>
<p class="answer placeholder">[To be filled - e.g., "YC alumni recommendation", "Hacker News", etc.]</p>

<h2>SUMMARY</h2>

<p><em>"Snyk is valued at $8.5B for scanning human code. We're building the Snyk for AI agents - and we're already live on npm."</em></p>
