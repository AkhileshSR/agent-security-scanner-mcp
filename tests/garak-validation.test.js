 * Garak red-team validation harness.
 * Tests prompt injection detection against probes modeled on Garak categories:
 *   - encoding: Base64, ROT13, Hex, Morse, Braille, Zalgo
 *   - promptinject: HijackHateHumansMini, HijackKillHumansMini, HijackLongPrompt
 *   - jailbreak: InstructionBypass, DoAnythingNow, GrandmaExploit, Goodside, CompetitorModel
 *
 * Run before and after fixes to compare detection rates.
